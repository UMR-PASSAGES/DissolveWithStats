qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Group entities with same value for one field, calculate statistics on the other fields

about=Choose a layer and a field for this layer. This plugin will merge all entities with the same value for this field, and can calculate statistics for each remaining field : min, max, sum, count, mean, median, standard deviation, first, last, concatenation and uniquification. Uniquification concatenate all values from a field without any duplicate. For example, from a polygon layer of provinces, with a country ID field and a population field, you can create a country layer with the sum of the population of its provinces for each country.
