{"ALG_DESC": "This plugin is based upon the QGIS \"dissolve\" tool but adds the possibility to keep or not the other fields, and to calculate statistics on these other fields such as count, first, last, concatenation and uniquification for string fields, count, first, last, min, max, mean, median, standard deviation, and sum for numeric fields.", "Statistics": "Enter a statistic for each field of your input layer. Possible values for numeric fields are : count, first, last, max, mean, median, min, sd and sum. Possible values for text fields are count, concat, first, last and unique.\nsd stands for standard deviation, concat for concatenation and unique for uniquification.\nIf you don't wish to keep a field, use the 'no' value for this field.\nValues must be entered in the same order as the order of the fields in your input layer, as you can see them in the attribute table. Values must be separated with semicolon (;).\nFor example, if your input layer has 3 fields and you want to calculate the sum for the first one, the count for the second one and not keep the third one, type : sum;count;no", "Output_Layer": "Ouput layer to be created", "ALG_CREATOR": "Julie Pierson, UMR 5319 Passages, CNRS", "ALG_VERSION": "0.4", "Input_layer": "Choose a layer to dissolve", "Dissolve_field": "All the geometries with the same value for this field will be merged together", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "Julie Pierson, UMR 5319 Passages, CNRS"}
